Now that you've imported our code, there's one more step you need to do to get a robot ready to roll,
<br>
Start up the robot! To do this, just call <code>R = Robot()</code>
<br>
This creates a new Robot object. Objects can be thought of as a collection of functions.
<br>
<em>You should only call Robot once!</em>
