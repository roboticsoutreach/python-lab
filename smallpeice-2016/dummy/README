This is the dummy library used for code checking in the IDE.

It provides the same interface as pyenv, but doesn't do anything.

The check-ref.py file is a sample usage of the interfaces, but is not definitive.
It is intended as a useful file for developing the IDE code checker against, and as validation for the dummy pyenv file.
