Your robot will almost certainly need some code to see where markers are. To get the list of markers the robot can see,
you just call:
<br><br>
R.see()
<br><br>
It will return a list of markers, each marker will have a type, and a value which gives you the id of the marker.
We won't tell you exactly what they are named &mdash; you will need to read the documentation to find out!
One very useful function for vision code is something which takes in all markers, and only returns markers which suit
certain criteria. (For example, return only normal tokens, instead of the poison token)
<br><br>
This task involves modifying 'find_token_markers' and 'find_poison_markers' so that they both return either only
markers which are not poisonous, and markers which are poisonous respectively.
