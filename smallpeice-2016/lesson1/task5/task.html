Your robot will almost certainly need some code to see where markers are. To get the list of markers the robot can see,
you just call:
<br><br>
R.see()
<br><br>
It will return a list of markers, each marker will have a type, and an 'offset', which is the id of the marker.
One very useful function for vision code is something which takes in all markers, and only returns markers which suit a
certain criteria. (for example, return only tokens, instead of the poison token)
<br><br>
This task involves modifying 'find_token_markers' and 'find_poison_markers' so that they both return either only
markers which are not poisonous, and markers which are poisonous respectively.
