    <h1>Aligning with markers</h1>
        <strong>This task has no tests!</strong> if you completely finish this task, you'll be in a very good standing for
        winning the competition on Friday!
    <br><br>
        You can use this code as a base for the code for your robot! Just create a new 'Pure Python' Project with a file
        named 'robot.py' and paste this code in. Copy the robot.py to your USB stick whenever you want to run it on your
        robot!
    <br><br>
        In this task, you've got the basic framework for a robot, but you want make it actually drive towards the nearest token
        and grab it!
    <br><br>
        Notice that the code provided to you has a 'state' variable, this is very useful as it is much easier to keep
        track of what the robot is currently doing with a variable than it is with 'if' statements, as you can go from any
        state to any other state very easily.
    <br><br>
        The first task you should do is figure a way to get the closest visible marker, check the documentation if you
        aren't sure how to get the distance. Then you should add a way of moving the robot based on where the token is, then
        you should add some code to carry the token to your scoring arena. You have the rest of the week to get this task done!

    <h2>Differences between the real life and the simulator:</h2>
        There are a few things to point out that are different in the simulator then they are in the real world:
    <ul>
        <li> The simulator models tokens as 1 marker each, the real world may see many of the same marker at the same time, as
        tokens have multiple faces, each with a different marker on.</li>
        <li>The position of the marker of the token in the simulator shows them as being in the centre of the token. The
            location of the centres of the markers in the real world will be the centre of the face which the marker is on.
        This means you could be 5cm off if you're trying to get to the centre of the token as opposed to the bit the robot
            can see.</li>
        <li>You can get the orientation of markers in the real robots (i.e. its rotation relative to the robot), however
            this feature is not yet supported in the simulator.</li>
        <li>There is a poison token on the centre of the arena. This token is not available in the simulator as there is
        no way of picking it up</li>
    </ul>
